# E08b-Debugging
An exercise where we went through and fixed errors in a script for a platformer. There were 8, there was an indent error, and capitalization error in the ui, useless line in playerdata, player.gd had capital stuff, end screen capital stuff, player data score line 20 wasn't needed, enemies weren't visible, enemy had a useless line.
